# book-worm

> save the words you find in the books you read

## Intro:

The motivation behind book worm was to have a place to keep track of all the words I kept coming across in the books I read. I wanted to have a place to store them and eventually do stuff with those words like study them and analyze them.

### version 1.0

The current version of book worm only allows you to create, update, read, and delete words. This is the bare bones of the app but future generation of the app will have other cool features like flash card study and allowing you to analyze what authors you record the most words from and what books have contributed to your book worm vocabulary.
